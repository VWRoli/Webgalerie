				<h3>Innovation</h3>

				<p><b>Big Bang Software Release:</b> Black Chip Poker just did a major software release with some new features and games.
					Flying Chip promotions, Double or Nothing games, Avatars, a Tournament Ticket Manager, and a Player Observer Tool are now live!
				</p>

				<p><b>$1,000,000 GTD Million Dollar Sundays:</b> Black Chip Poker took the poker industry by storm in 2015 by bringing back $1,000,000 GTD Million Dollar Sunday tourneys to the US market.
					Their 10th one happens on April 30th. They are the only US facing network to come close to offering guaranteed prize pools of this size.
				</p>

				<p><b>New Tournament Schedule:</b> As of January 2017, Black Chip Poker expanded their tournament schedule with $500k more in guarantees each week.  With $100k in prize pools added to Mondays,
					 $40k added to the daily morning schedule and double the special tournaments on Saturdays, along with new “Top 10 Tournaments”,
					 Black Chip Poker has a schedule that now rivals all other major sites.
				</p>

				<p><b>Tournament Series:</b> Each year, Black Chip Poker guarantees millions of dollars in prize pools through their exciting Online Super Series,
					High Five Tournament Series and Freebuy Super Series events. In 2016 they hosted a record 9 series throughout the year.
				</p>

				<p><b>Jackpot Poker:</b> Black Chip Poker is part of the only US facing network to offer these exciting 3-person hyper turbos Sit & Go’s where players can hit it big for a small investment.
					The tourneys are available in Texas Hold'em and Pot Limit Omaha formats and players can enter for $2 (play for up to $5,000), $10 (play for up to $25,000) or $40 (play for up to $100,000).
					The prize pool is randomly drawn right before the start of the tournament.
				</p>

				</h2>

				<p><b>The Beast:</b> This unique weekly rake race awards cash prizes and tournament tickets to cash game grinders every week.
					This extra incentive is over and above BCP’s lucrative VIP program and is of absolutely no cost to the player.  A portion of the rake is funneled to a cash leaderboard.
					The more hands a player plays, the higher they rank on the leaderboard and the more cash they make at the end of the race.
					To date, The Beast has awarded over $6.7 million in cash and tournament entries to players on the network.
				</p>

				<p><b>The Cage:</b> This nosebleed cash game in a time based tournament format is the first of its kind.
					Players may buy-in directly or qualify via satellites for this 5 hour long $1000+$50 buy-in event. The blinds increase each hour of this “Must Play Event” with blinds from $5/$10 up to $25/$50.
					Whatever chips the player has at the end of the 5 hours is converted to cold hard cash!
				</p>

				<p><b>Punta Cana Poker Classic:</b> Black Chip Poker is proud to sponsor one of the world’s best land-based poker tourneys.
					Last year’s 2016 PCPC took place at the luxurious Melia Caribe Resort in the Dominican Republic.
					he Main Event was a $500,000 GTD and BCP awarded over 120 prize packages via online qualifiers.
				</p>

				<p><b>WSOP Main Event Qualifiers:</b> BCP qualified 50 players for $12,500 prize packages, with a total of $625,000 awarded.
				</p>

				<p><b>Spin to Get IN:</b> Black Chip Poker is one of the few sites offering re-entry technology for which a player can buy-in again upon elimination to any of its tournaments while the tourney
					is still in late registration.  Players can now also Spin to Get IN.  Upon elimination, players can spin a slot machine and get right back into any one of the tournaments for as little as
					 one penny.
					Thousands of dollars in entries have been won so far!

				<h3>Software and Graphics </h3>

				<p>The Winning Poker Network recently upgraded their software which has given the network and BCP a huge boost.
					The software is very user friendly and allows for easy multi-tabling options, clean graphics, and smooth gameplay.

					The software allows players to easily navigate between tournaments and cash games, and filter their preferred playing size and limit, and game selection.
				</p>

				<p>Black Chip Poker also has a new Tournament User Interface that includes features such as Hand for Hand Dealing, Synchronized Breaks, Internal and External Lobby Improvements,
					On-Table Tournament Statistics Display, On-Table In-the-Money Symbol, and Progressive Pay-outs technology.
				</p>

				<p>The Progressive Pay-outs technology is unique to the Winning Poker Network, allowing players to receive their winnings as soon as the money bubble bursts of any multi-table tournament.
					Players no longer have to wait for elimination or winning the tournament to receive their cash.
				</p>
